## Git Workflow & Pushing Changes

1. **Check current branch**

```

2. **Pull latest changes**

```bash
git pull origin main
```

3. **Create a new branch for your feature**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

4. **Add your changes**

```bash
git add .
```

5. **Commit your changes**

```bash
git commit -m "Add feature description"
```

6. **Push your branch to GitHub**

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

7. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub to merge your feature into `main`.

8. **After merging**, switch back to `main` and pull latest changes:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

```

This is fully raw markdown — ready to save as `README.md`.  

If you want, I can also **add badges and links** (like license, GitHub actions, and issues) to make it look like a professional GitHub README. Do you want me to do that?
